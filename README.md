## Before running `bundle install`
``` bash
gem install github-pages  # So the required version of Jekyll is used
bundle add webrick        # Jekyll couldn't find webrick. This should probably be in the Gemfile. This should be verified.
```


## Run the site locally for development.
``` bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
