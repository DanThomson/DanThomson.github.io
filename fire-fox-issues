1) Firefox does not support setHTML, so replace that with
    sanitation followed by assigning a string to .innerHTML.

2) Firefox does not seem to be supporting bare imports from
    locations defined in importmap. I suspect firefox supports such
    imports when they are made by scripts located within the html, but
    not to scripts linked from the html.
