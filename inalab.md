1. Yes, BS from UIC in Mathematics
2. No certificate in AWS, however I am interested in pursuing said certificate.
3. 5 years of experience
    1. AWS yes
    2. lambda yes
    3. Batch no
    4. Postgres yes
    5. Python yes
    6. Chalice no
    7. SQLAlchemy yes
    8. Alembic yes
    9. Pydantic no
    10. Flask yes
    11. FastAPI -- no but 5 years with OpenAPI / Swagger (in 2017 Swagger was renamed OpenAPI after I started working with it)
    12. ElasticSearch -- no but 1 year
    13. VueJS -- no but about 1 year
    14. Crowd no
    15. Keycloak no but experience with OAuth
    16. Jira yes
    17. Gitlab -- no but more than a year
    18. Slack yes
    19. MS Teams -- no
    20. JSON yes
4. Yes -- I have lots of experience Troubleshooting live systems (Sears and TNX in particular)
5. Develop and maintain cloud-native applications --  With the exception of my work at Sears and UPS all of my experience has been with cloud based applications.
6. Develop new FastAPI and GraphQL endpoints.
    1. I expect my experience with OpenAPI and Flask will translate to FastAPI.
    2. While I don't include it on my resume, I worked with a framework called Hug while at TNX. Hug and FastAPI are similar, so similar that FastAPI mentions Hug on its page [Alternatives, Inspiration and Comparisons](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/alternatives/#hug)
    2. Although GraphQL is a query language and MongoDB is a database, my experience with MongoDB should prove useful. One of my projects at SEARS was creating a micro-service which gave other developers at SEARS access to a restricted form of MongoDB's own query language. That included an api. There are some similarities between GraphQL and MongoDB's query language.
7. Update the Pydantic data model -- Although I have not worked with Pydantic, I very familiar with data validation work. I expect I'll learn Pydantic quite quickly, and that Pydantic will be my next best friend.
8. Postgres Database Schemas -- I live for this type of work
9. GitLab environments, using a CI/CD approach
    1. I've done a decent amount of work doing Continuous Integration with Jenkins and Travis CI.
    2. I've also done Deployment work with Jenkins and GitHub.
    3. I expect those experiences will allow me to do CI/CD with GitLab
9. Implementation of Keycloak authentication/authorization protocols -- I've done authentication / authorization work with OAuth. I expect I'll learn Keycloak quickly.
