# Todo
- copy in html boilerplate
- Turtle code should work with an existing svg element. It will create a path object who's g attribute is written based on the turtle code.
- Future implentations should have text boxes which allow the setting of variables like step size and turn angle.
- Then create code which will create a sequence of successive svg elements each of which displaying a rewrite of the original turtle code along with the interpertation.

## Remember, starting out it is just html boilerplate, an svg element, and a path element.

## Future ideas
- On page 11 of ABoP, there are references to the inference problem, and graph grammers. Both could be interesting followups.
